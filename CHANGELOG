### v1.0.3
* Updated the suggestions list.

### v1.0.2

* Broke out the dictionary arrays into separate files. I need to add more words to the suggestion list.

### v1.0.1
* Changed the way the domain string is built.
* Had internal conflicts about adding the protocol to the domain, too risky with unfurling.

### v1.0.0
* Inital release

* Totally didn't rip contents from dumb.domains.
